## 🦄 Unique Feature: The Carbon Time Machine

What truly sets CarbonZero apart is its focus on **tangible, long-term impact visualization**. exploring the "What if?" scenario:

**"If everyone lived like you, what would happen to Earth?"**

-   **🌍 Earths Needed**: Instead of just abstract CO2 numbers, we show you how many planets would be required to sustain the human population if everyone adopted your lifestyle.
    
-   **🌡️ 2050 Temperature Projection**: We calculate a personalized forecast of global temperature rise by 2050 based on your emission levels, directly linking your daily choices to future climate outcomes.

-   **Context-Aware Feedback**: The app doesn't just give you a number; it tells you if you are "Sustainable", in "Overshoot", or at a "Critical" level, making the data emotionally resonant and actionable.
